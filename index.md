I am a cross-media digital designer and developer well-versed in both design and code. I love the web and working on projects that allow me to push the limits of concept and creativity. My recent focus has been on responsive and component based systems, prototype building, performance, and user experience. Iâ€™m constantly looking out for new trends and technologies to help me stay ahead and look forward to joining a team that shares this passion.
